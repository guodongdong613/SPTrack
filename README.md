# SPTrack: Spectral Similarity Prompt Learning for Hyperspectral Object Tracking
We propose a spectral similarity prompt learning approach for hyperspectral object tracking (SPTrack)ï¼Œextensive experiments are conducted on the HOT2023 and IMEC25 datasets, and SPTrack is found to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational effort. Additionally, we verify the cross-spectral domain generalization ability of SPTrack on the HOT2023 dataset, which includes data from three spectral bands.
