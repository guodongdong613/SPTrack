We have disclosed all the results of SPTrack on the HOT2023 and IMEC25 datasets, and will release the code in the future.
In the HOT2023 folder, there are results obtained using models based on three different spectral matching maps: ED, SAM, and SSS. In the IMEC25 folder, we only provide the best-performing method based on the SAM spectral matching map.
